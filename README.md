# Griffin's dotfiles

These are the personalized settings I use for various command-line programs. Installation is provided by [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). Machine-specific customizations are stored in a private repository. Large portions of these settings are pulled from [Anish Athalye's wonderfully constructed dotfiles](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles).
